# Near-term TODO List

- Research Rust testing patterns
- Plan the dumb terminal modules
  - Telnet Protocol
  - ANSI Protocol
  - Virtual Terminal
- Implement a basic TUI with slash commands
- Get to functional state comparable with command-line telnet but with separate user input field.
- Logging
- Implement some hard-coded real-time pattern matching
- Implement Room Capture/Observation logic
  - This means identify room titles, descriptions, exit options, and such.
- Implement Room Movement Observation logic
- Implement Cartography logic wherein user can tie together room observations with movement observations to create a "map" that can be viewed.
- Implement a map viewer. (Just a little thing, right?)
